This is based on this tutorial:

But to learn more thoroughly, I will attempt to make a roles-style
playbook that covers the following concepts - gleaned from the example above.


o  go straight for roles architecture
o  use ansible-galaxy
o  use a handler
o  use these modules:
    o  apt, incl adding new repo
    o  shell
    o  file
    o  copy
    o  service // Drop this one - don't think it's viable on a Docker container host
o  use become - pref at playbook scope
o  use templates
o  register / when
o  role scope vars
o  role dependencies
o  encrypted variables incl retrospective
o  use facts
o  use a third party role
