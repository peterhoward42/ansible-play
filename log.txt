o  Looking at CircleCI deployment to GCE - whoo how about that!
	*  Source:
	https://circleci.com/blog/simplifying-your-ci-cd-build-pipeline-to-gke-with-circleci-orbs/
	*  Get or refresh GCP account
	*  Create <hsbc-proj-1> project
	*  Install and init gcloud sdk
	*  Create a cluster <hsbc-cluster-1>
	*  Scale the number of nodes back to zero when not in use
	*  Init a kube-config locally
	*  Tag and push the local images
		*  controlnode
			*  tag as: eu.gcr.io/hsbc-proj-1/controlnode
			*  Need to authenticate docker to gcloud
			*  push the image to gcr
		*  managednode
			*  tag 
			*  push the image to gcr
	*  Get a manual deployment working
		*  For the managed node
		*  For the control node
		*  scale down the cluster
	*  Switch this to study to have a record
	o  On to CircleCI...
		*  make a starter .circleci/config.yaml and make sure not git ignored
		*  scrutinize it to work out what it is doing
		*  cut out redundant bits
			*  don't need the build steps
		*  edit... change filenames etc.
		*  gun for just managedimage to start wiht
		o  create gcp service account
		o  create circle project


		o  now add control node
		o  update summary notes
		o  can specify build args as per docker compose


o  Next steps for automating it with circleci
	o  maybe look first at a circleci tutorial
	o  study what the circle ci config is doing - so as to work out
	   how much I should copy or change - because it's not a node app.


o  Upgrade README and comments in ansible-play repo to reflect the dual modes 
   of k8s vs docker-compose





o  Going to shelve this at this point to switch focus to wider topics rather
   than go deeper...


o  Get onto ansible tutorial proper
	*  Look ahead at subjects
	*  Put these in studies
	o  Work thru them - making them my own, leaving trail in tutorial dir.
		*  put goals into tutorial dir
		*  design something to exercise it
		o  get started
			*  install ansible locally to play with galaxy in /tmp
			*  use ansible-galaxy to make the fs
			*  check its mounted into the control node dynamically
			*  make a task to install ag using the shell module, and
				*  try playbook again = works yeah!
			o  experiment creating a file and setting perms on it with the
			   file module
			   	*  use it to touch a file 
				*  rename the playbook to be example or learning
				*  comment the tasks better
				o  later will use 'when' it is created to stimulate
				   a task that kicks ag with a search that depends on it


o  Look into tests
	o  There is a folder called tests in the galaxy tree.

o  Defining your own module?

		

o  Add nginx installation to tutorial, and mount it into control node.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*  use galaxy to create the role filesystem in the tutorial folder,
*  add a readme to it to say that i used galaxy to do so
*  install ag with apt
o  use file module to write a file with a template and set permissions on it
o  consume a variable for this task ?
o  use the ag installed to grep inside that file
o  register a variable with the stdout of the ag grep
o  have a when that consumes that result
o  can use dependencies to wait for file creation and for ag to be installed
o  use copy to do some arbitrary copy if can't think of anything better
o  become root at role or playbook scope
o  add encryption of variables
o  not sure how to work in facts
o  did handlers get used?
o  add a third party role


o  other ideas
	o  install memcached
