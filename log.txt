o  Consider control node and docker compose story
	o  How should the control node be different?
	o  Is there a public image?, although we'll want to mount the
	   tutorial into it, and give it some keys - no std image
	o  Start working up from scratch
		*  Base Ubuntu 18.04 (has python 3.6)
		*  Install ansible
		o  Create non-root user with sudo privileges
		o  Access to a rsa key-pair dedicated to this user
		o  Copy this key pair onto the control node

	o  Go back to managednode to copy on the public ansible keypair as
	   well as mine. Can retain the user as root in this case.

	o  the keys we installed on managednode are good for me sshingin from
	   docker host, but the ansible control node will need another pair
	   right? to ssh from control node to managednode?

o  start the tutorial
    o  attempt to get the nginx playbook to work, then document it,
		o  wonder if bad example, with nginx also being a long running
		   server? Could try I suppose.
