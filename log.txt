o  Make keys simpler - just have them in the repo
o  Move docker files into common dir and put keys there too
	*  rename and move docker files up
	*  have make build them from there
	*  in the docker build copy keys from docker fs
	*  manually install keys into a ssh dir under common root
	*  test
		*  fix build errors
		*  fix run errors
		*  are keys where they should be on
		*  can ctrlnode ssh into managednode?

o  Can we get more friendly hostnames?
o  Should control node docker file use fewer layers with continuation lines?
o  Looks like apt install ansible brings in python2.7 - do I need to
   specify a particular version of ansible?
o  Sort out hosts file on controlnode
o  Integration test?
o  Add nginx installation to tutorial, and mount it into control node.
