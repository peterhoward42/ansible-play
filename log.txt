o  So now we can use (separate) make commands to bring up the infrastructure
	*  Upgrade the makefile to make both images as a place holder to
	   inject mutual dependencies at image level. Will probably deprecate
	   doing the running from there later when got compose running.
		*  Target to make images calls each separate target to make image
		*  Comment out run targets
	o  Get compose to the level that brings up all 3 machines
		o  Try naive compose file
			o  Presumably the lack of run paramaters will cause problems?
				o  It doesn't say to run them as -d
					o  But you can on the docker-compose cmd line (-d)
				o  It doesn't say to remove the container on exit
				o  It doesn't port map
				o  It doesn't name the container
				o  It doesn't scale the managed nodes
	o  Consider adding a compose up make target
	o  Add a down target

o  Sort out hosts file on controlnode
o  Correct key pair in use to be one minted for this story and reproducible
   in e.g. CI context with no prior setup dependency.
o  Add nginx installation to tutorial, and mount it into control node.
